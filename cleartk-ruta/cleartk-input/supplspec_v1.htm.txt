Supplementary Specification

Introduction
1.1    Purpose
The purpose of this document is to define requirements of the Wylie course registration (C-Registration) system. This Supplementary Specification lists the requirements that are not readily captured in the use cases of the use-case model. The Supplementary Specifications and the use-case model together capture a complete set of requirements on the system.

1.2    Scope
This Supplementary Specification applies to the Wylie course registration system which will be developed by the Wylie College Information Systems (IT) department. The IT department will develop this client-server system to interface with the existing course catalog database.

The C-Registration System will enable students to register for courses on-line. The C-Registration System allows professors to select their teaching courses and to maintain student grades.

This specification defines the non-functional requirements of the system; such as reliability, usability, performance, and supportability as well as functional requirements that are common across a number of use cases. (The functional requirements are defined in the Use Case Specifications.)

    2.    Functionality
This section lists functional requirements that are common to more than one use case.

2.1    System Error Logging
All system errors shall be logged. Fatal system errors shall result in an orderly shutdown of the system.

The system error messages shall include a text description of the error, the operating system error code (if applicable), the module detecting the error condition, a data stamp, and a time stamp. All system errors shall be retained in the Error Log Database.

2.2    Remote Access
All functionality shall be available remotely through an internet connection. This may require applications or controllers running on the remote computers.

    3.    Usability
This section lists all of those requirements that relate to, or affect, the usability of the system.

3.1    Windows Compliance
The desktop user-interface shall be Windows 95/98 compliant.

3.2    Design for Ease-of-Use
The user interface of the C-Registration System shall be designed for ease-of-use and shall be appropriate for a computer-literate user community with no additional training on the System.

3.3    Online Help
Each feature of the C-Registration System shall have built-in online help for the user. Online Help shall include step by step instructions on using the System. Online Help shall include definitions for terms and acronyms.

    4.    Reliability
This section lists all reliability requirements.

4.1    Availability
The C-Registration System shall be available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. There shall be no more than 4% down time.

4.2    Mean Time Between Failures
      Mean Time Between Failures shall exceed 300 hours.

    5.    Performance
The performance characteristics of the system are outlined in this section.

5.1    Simultaneous Users
The system shall support up to 2000 simultaneous users against the central database at any given time, and up to 500 simultaneous users against the local servers at any one time.

5.2    Database Access Response Time
The system shall provide access to the legacy course catalog database with no more than a 10 second latency.

5.3    Transaction Response Time
       The system must be able to complete 80% of all transactions within 2 minutes.

    6.    Supportability
This section defines any requirements that will enhance the supportability or maintainability of the system being built.

6.1    New Releases Downloadable
Upgrades to the PC client portion of C-Registration shall be downloadable from the UNIX Server over the internet. This feature enables students to have easy access to system upgrades.

    7.    Design Constraints
This section lists any design constraints on the system being built.

7.1    Course Catalog Legacy System
The system shall integrate with existing legacy system (course catalog database) which operates on the College DEC VAX Main Frame.

7.2    Billing System
The C-Registration System shall interface with the existing Course Billing System which operates on the College DEC VAX Main Frame.

7.3    Platform Requirements
The client portion of the C-Registration System shall operate on any personal computer with a 486 processor or greater. The client portion shall require less than 20 MB disk space and 32 MB RAM.

The server portion of the C-Registration System shall operate on the Wylie College UNIX server.

7.4    Internet Browsers
The web-based interface for the C-Registration System shall run in Netscape 4.0.4 and Internet Explorer 4.0 browsers.

7.5    Java Compatibility
The web-based interface shall be compatible with the Java 1.1 VM runtime environment.
